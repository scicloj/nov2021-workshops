Work in progress.

This project demonstrates the emerging Clojure data science stack by exploring data from the Clojurians Zulip.

The included data are an annonymized versio, that was created using `prepare.clj`from the raw data collected using the Zulip API. The raw data is not included here.

See `explore.clj` for the data exploration.

This is joint work of Sami Kallinen, Ethan Miller, and Daniel Slutsky.
