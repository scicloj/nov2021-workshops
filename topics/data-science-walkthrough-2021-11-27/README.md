Work in progress.

This project demonstrates scicloj.ml machine learning pipelines by exploring data from the Clojurians Zulip.

The included data are an annonymized version, that was created using `prepare.clj` from the raw data collected using the Zulip API. The raw data is not included here.

See `ml.clj` for the machine learning part.

This is joint work of Sami Kallinen, Ethan Miller, and Daniel Slutsky.
